    \textbf{19.4} Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be finite sets. Prove or disprove: 
    If $|A\cup B \cup C | = |A| + |B| + |C|$,
    then $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be pairwise disjoint.

    \textbf{19.5} How many five-letter “words” can you make 
    in which no two consecutive letters are
    the same?
    A “word” may be any list of the standard 26 letters, so WENJW is a word you would count, 
    but NUTTY is not.\\

    Here is an easy solution: By the list-counting methods of Section 8, the answer is
    $26 􏰂\times 25 \times 25 \times􏰂 25 \times􏰂 25 = 26 􏰂\times 25^4$.\\

    Give a hard solution using inclusion-exclusion, and then show that the two answers are the same.

    \textbf{19.6} This problem asks you to give two proofs for
    $$
    9^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \binom{n}{k} 10^{n-k}
    $$

    \indent \textbf{a.} The first proof should use the binomial theorem (see Theorem 17.8).\\
    \indent \textbf{b.} The second should be a combinatorial proof using inclusion-exclusion.

    \textbf{19.7} How many six-digit numbers do not have three consecutive digits the same? 
    (For this problem, you may consider six-digit numbers whose initial digits might be 0. Thus you
    should count 012345 and 001122, but not 000987 or 122234.)
