\begin{framed}
	\textbf{49.10.} Let $G$ be a graph. Prove that $G$ or 
	$\overline{G}$ (or both) must be connected.
\end{framed}

\begin{framed}
	\textbf{49.11.} Let $G$ be a graph with $n \geq 2$ vertices. Prove that
	if $\delta(G) \geq \frac{1}{2}n$, then $G$ is connected.\\

	Reminder: The maximum degree of a vertex in G is denoted $\Delta(G)$
	and the minimum degree of a vertex in G is denoted $\delta(G)$.

\begin{framed}
	\textbf{49.12.} Let $G$ be a graph with $n \geq 2$ vertices.\\

	\textbf{a.} Prove that if $G$ has at least $\binom{n-1}{2}+1$ edges,
	then $G$ is connected.

	\textbf{b.} Show that the result in (a) is best possible: that is, for
	each $n \geq 2$ prove that there is a graph with $\binom{n-1}{2}$ edges that is
	not connected.
\end{framed}

\begin{framed}
	\textbf{49.14.} Let $A$ b the adjacency matrix of a graph G. That is,
	we label the vertices of G as $v_1, v_2,...v_n$. The matrix $A$ is an
	$n \times n$ matrix whose $i,j-$entry is 1 if $v_iv_j \in E(G)$ and is $0$
	otherwise.

	Let $k \in N$. Prove that the $i,j-$entry of $A^k$ is the number of walks of length
	$k$ from $v_i$ to $v_j$.
