    \textbf{37.3} Solve the following equations for $[x]$ in the $Z/nZ$ specified.
    Note: These are quite different
    from the previous set of problems. Why?
    Be sure you find all solutions.

    \textbf{a.} $[2][x] = [4]$ in $Z/10Z$.

    \textbf{b.} $[2][x] = [3]$ in $Z/10Z$.

    \textbf{c.} $[9][x] = [4]$ in $Z/12Z$.

    \textbf{d.} $[9][x] = [6]$ in $Z/12Z$.
\end{framed}

    \textbf{37.4} Here are a few more equations for you to solve in the Zn specified. 
    Be sure to find all solutions.

    \textbf{a.} $[x][x] = [1]$ in $Z/13Z$.

    \textbf{b.} $[x][x] = [11]$ in $Z/13Z$.

    \textbf{c.} $[x][x] = [12]$ in $Z/13Z$.

    \textbf{d.} $[x][x] = [4]$ in $Z/15Z$.

    \textbf{e.} $[x][x] = [10]$ in $Z/15Z$.

    \textbf{f.} $[x][x] = [14]$ in $Z/15Z$.

    \textbf{37.10} For ordinary integers, the following is true. 
    If $ab = 0$, then $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. The
    analogous statement for $Z/nZ$ is not necessarily true. 
    For example, in $Z/10Z$, $[2][5] = [0]$ but $[2] \neq [0]$ and 
    $[5] \neq [0]$. 
    However, for some values of $n$ (e.g., $n = 5$) it is true 
    that $[a][b] = 0$ implies $[a] = 0$ or $[b] = 0$.

    For which values of $n \geq 2$ does the implication
    $$
    [a][b] = 0 \Longleftrightarrow [a] = [0] \text{ or } [b] = [0]
    $$
    hold in $Z/Zn$?
    Prove your answer.

    \textbf{37.12} Let n be a positive integer and suppose 
    $[a], [b] \in Z/nZ$ are both invertible. Prove or disprove
    each of the following statements. 
    
    \textbf{a.} $[a] + [b]$ is invertible.
    
    \textbf{b.} $[a] - [b]$ is invertible.
    
    \textbf{c.} $[a][b]$ is invertible.
    
    \textbf{d.} $[a]/[b]$ isinvertible.
