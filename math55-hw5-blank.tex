    \textbf{17.33} A poker hand consists of 5 cards chosen from a standard deck of 52 cards.
    There are a variety of special hands that one can be dealt in poker. For
    each of the following types of hands, count the number of hands that have that type.\\

    \indent \textbf{a.} Four of a kind: The hand contains four cards of the same numerical value (e.g., four
    jacks) and another card.\\
    \indent \textbf{b.} Three of a kind: The hand contains three cards of the same numerical value and two
    other cards with two other numerical values.\\
    \indent \textbf{c.} Flush: The hand contains five cards all of the same suit.\\
    \indent \textbf{d.} Full house: The hand contains three cards of one value and two cards of another value.\\
    \indent \textbf{e.} Straight: The five cards have consecutive numerical values, such as 7-8-9-10-jack.
    Treat ace as being higher than king but not less than 2. The suits are irrelevant.\\
    \indent \textbf{f.} Straight flush: The hand is both a straight and a flush.
